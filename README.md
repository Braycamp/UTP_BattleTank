# UTP_BattleTank
An Open-world head-to-head tank fighting game with simple AI, terrain design, and some advanced control systems within Unreal Engine 4.

This game was made by Brayden Campbell before Sub-Par Gaming Studios was created or before production on Land of the Lost had began. It is used as a tool to understand and learn how to utalize the Unreal Engine to the fullest with C++ Coding and Blueprint.
